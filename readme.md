# Manual KMeans

This is a manual implementation of a KMeans algorithm using python and numpy.

**v0**: Algorithm finished - this version can find optmial coordinates for cluster centers.

> ToDo  
1 . create the KMeans Class;<br>
2 . review the optmization process;<br>
3 . create a chart for every iteration of the algorithm;<br>
4 . animate the chart.
